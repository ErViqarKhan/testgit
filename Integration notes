Integration:
------------
An enterprise uses many applications, which is designed to manage the data related to the part of the business.

Many of the applications has been built by using different platforms.

Integration generally means combining parts so that they work together or form a whole. 

	
Benefits of Integration:
------------------------
	Offers all-in-one access:
		Employees won’t have to switch systems to get what they need. They can stay logged into one system to 		get everything done.

	Increases productivity:
		Teams do a lot of cutting and pasting data to ensure it appears in all systems. However, manual tasks 		can lead to mistakes and turn into a time-waster. Integrated systems have automated checks and 		balances to ensure they have the same information. The time spent duplicating data will go away and 		employees get more done.

	Provides effortless access to data:
		System integration allows data to be accessed from all the integrated systems.

	Enhances communication:
		One department may be more comfortable with Salesforce while another prefers to work with a different 		system. Integrating the two systems allows each team to work in the system they prefer, which 		streamlines communications and leads to more information sharing.

	Automates workflows without any code:
		Since integrated systems play nice together, their workflows can be automated with point-and-click.

	Provides more insightful reporting:
		Employees get more detailed and relevant reports

Ways to Integrate:
------------------
	1. User Interface Integration
	2. Business Logic Integration
	3. Data Integration

Ways to Implement Integration:
------------------------------
	We have below common approaches to have the integration of Salesforce application with any external system.

		1. Outbound Messaging. 
		2. Email Services (Inbound) 
		3. Call Ins 
		4. Call Outs

	WebServices:
============
WebService are nothing but the Custom Business Logic, which can be accessible by the External Systems.

By using WebServices we can provide the communication between the different disparate systems, which has been developed by using different programming languages and running on different platforms.

WebServices provides the Platform-independent communication between the applications.

		Salesforce		<------ WebServices  ------>    Java
		Application						  				Application	
		
By using WebServices, we can expose the Data(Records), Business Logics and functionalities to the Third Party Systems.

By using Apex Programming, we can implement 2 Types of WebServices

	1. REST Based WebServices
	2. SOAP Based WebServices
	
REST Based WebServices / Apex REST:
===================================
	REST --> Representational State Transfer.
	
	By using REST,  we can access the Resources over the internet with the help of HTTP protocol.
	
	REST is an Architectural Style, which has been purely built upon HTTP protocol. It used the HTTP protocol internally to provide the communication between the applications.
	
	In REST WebServices, each Object, Business Logic and Class and Functionalities should be implemented in the form of a "Resource".
	
	Each Resource should be identified by using a "Resource Name". The Developer can provide the resource name based on the need.
	
	Ex:
		Table Name		Resource Name
		-------------------------------
		Account 			001
		Contact				003
		Opportunity			006
		Case				500
		Solution			501
		Lead				00Q
		Campaign			701
		Order				801
		User				005
		Task				00T
		Event				00U
		Group				00G
		...
		...
	
	Every resource can be accessible by using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
	Ex:
		https://sample.com/<resourceName>
		
	Ex:
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/001 ---> Account Object Records
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/500 ---> Case Object Records
		
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/apex/ShowAllAccountsPage ---> Visualforce Page
		
	To access the resources we have to specify the HTTP Method, which indicates what type of operation the user wants to perform on the resource. 
	
	HTTP Protocol provides the below Methods.
	
		1. GET (To Retrieve the Records from the Resource / Object)
		2. POST (To Insert the Records into the Resource / Object)
		3. PUT  (To Update the records into the Resource)
		4. PATCH (To Perform both INSERT + UPDATE operations on the resource)
		5. DELETE (To Delete the records from the object / resource)
		
	Note:
		REST based WebServices can provide the results in the form of "XML / JSON / TEXT".
		
	Upon Creating the REST WebServices, we have to use the below Annotations.

		1. @RestResource()
		2. @HttpGet()
		3. @HttpPost()
		4. @HttpPut()
		5. @HttpPatch()
		6. @HttpDelete()
		
@RestResource:
==============
	This annotation is used to expose an apex class / business logic class to the Third Party Applications.
	
	Inside the Class, we can provide the required Business Logic in the form of various methods.
	
	Note:
		Always WebService class should be defined with "Global" access specifier. We have to specify the resource name for the class by using "@RestResource()" annotation on top of the Class as below.
		
	Syntax:
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/<ResourceName>/*')
		Global Class <ClassName>
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
		
	Ex:
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountsService/*')
		Global Class AccountsManager
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
		
		
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/CommonService/*')
		Global Class CommonHelper
		{
			// Write the Business Logic...
		}
		
Accessing the Resource:
-----------------------
	We can access / invoke each Resource by using a URI over the "http protocol".
	
	Syntax:
		https://<ServerNumber>.Salesforce.com/services/apexrest/<ResourceName>
		
	Ex:
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/CommonService
		
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/AccountsService
		
	We can invoke / test the rest WebServices by using the below tools.

			1. Workbench Tool
			2. Postman Tool
			3. HP QTP Tool
			4. Through Apex Programming
			5. By using Third Party Applications
			6. By using Integration Tools
				(Ex: Tibco, WeMethods, SeeBeyond, BizTalk, MuleSoft,...etc.)
		
@HttpGet Method:
================
This annotation is used to get the required resource information from the Provider to Consumer.

Note: This annotation can be applicable only on method level (i.e. Procedure / Function)

Note:
	All the WebService methods should be defined with "Global" access specifier, and should be defined as "Static".
	
Syntax:
	@HttpGet
	Global static <ReturnType> <MethodName>()
	{
		// Write the Business Logic..
	}
	
Note:
	We can't create multiple methods inside the WebService class with the same annotation.
	(Ex: We can have only one "@HttpGet" annotated method inside the WebService class).
	
Ex:
	@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountRecordsService/*')
	Global Class AccountsManager
	{
		@HttpGet
		Global Static List<Account> GetAllAccounts()
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
	}
	
UseCase:
========
	Create a Restful WebService to get All the Account Records from the Account Object.
	
WebService Class:
-----------------
@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountsService/*')
Global class AccountsManagerService 
{
    @HttpGet
	Global static List<Account> GetAllAccountRecords()
    {
        List<Account> lstAccounts = [Select id, name, rating, industry, annualrevenue,
                                    				phone, fax, type, active__C
                                    					from Account
                                    						Order by name];

	3. Create a WebService, to access all the Position Records whose Status is "In Progress".
	
RestContext Class:
==================
This Class is used to establish the secured communication channel between the Provider and the Consumer. So that Consumer can pass the required input parameters to the Provider.

Then provider can return the required information to the consumer.

It contains the below inner Classes.

	1. RestRequest Class;
		This Class is used to make a request to the WebService to get the required information.
		
		The Consumer can pass the required input parameters to the WebService by using RestRequest class, so that they can get the required response from the WebService.
		
		Note:
			It will store the input parameters in the form of "Key-Value" pairs. Where Key --> Parameter Name. Value --> Parameter Value.
			
		Ex:
						Key				 Value
					  ---------------------------------
					    Id				'001464564564'
						Name			'Test'
						Rating			'Education'
						AnnualRevenue 	10000
			
		Property:
			Params:
				This property contains all the Input Parameters supplied by the Consumer to the WebService Class.
				
				It contains the information in the form of a Map Collection. We can collect the input parameters from the "RestRequest" class as below.
				
				Syntax:
					Map<String,String> <objectName> = RestContext.Request.Params;
					
				Ex:
					Map<String, String> inputParams = RestContext.Request.Params;
					
	2. RestResponse Class:
		By using this class, we can collect the response from the WebService class to the Third Party Application.

OAuth Authentication:
=====================

Future Callouts:
================








=================================================================================================================================================================================================================
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================



HTTP Class:
===========
Use the Http class to initiate an HTTP request and response.

Methods: 
--------
1. Send(httpRequest):
	This method will send the HTTP Request to the specified end-point and returns the HTTP Response.

2. ToString(): 
	Returns a string used to identify the object’s properties.

HttpRequest Class:
==================
HttpRequest class is used to programmatically create HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

We can send the Request along with the required method Type.

We can send the Request Headers, if needed for the Authentication of End-Point.

We can Set the Connection Timeouts.

We can send the Content to End-point in the form of message body.
	
Methods:
--------
	1. SetMethod(‘GET’)
	2. SetEndPoint(‘https://gmail.com/accounts/’)
	3. Setbody(‘Request Body’)
	4. SetClientCertificateName(ceritifcateName)
	5. SetTimeOut(Time)
	6. SetHeader(Key,Vaue)
	7. SetCompressed(Boolean)
	
Ex:
	HttpRequest postalRequest = new HttpRequest();
		
		postalRequest.SetEndPoint('https://api.postalpincode.in/pincode/500038');
		postalRequest.SetMethod('GET');
		postalRequest.SetTimeOut(10000); (Between 1 - 1,20,000 MilliSeconds)

HttpResponse Class:
===================
Use the HttpResponse class to handle the HTTP response returned by the Http class.

We can get the Content of the Response Body.

We can Set the Response Header, if needed.

We can Set and Get the Status Code returned by HTTP Request class.

Methods:
--------
	1. GetBody()
	2. GetStatus()
	3. GetStatusCode()
	4. GetXMLStreamReader()

Ex:	
	Http postalHttp = new Http();

	HttpRequest postalRequest = new HttpRequest();
		
		postalRequest.SetEndPoint('https://api.postalpincode.in/pincode/500038');
		postalRequest.SetMethod('GET');
		postalRequest.SetTimeOut(10000);

	HttpResponse postalResponse = postalHttp.Send(postalRequest);
	
	string response = postalResponse.GetBody();	
	system.debug('Response is....: '+ response);
	
Steps to Invoke the Third Party WebServices:
============================================
	Step 1: Get the Details of the WebService to be get invoked.
				1. EndPoint URL.
				2. Method Name
				3. Required Input Parameters
				4. Authorization Codes
				
	Step 2: We need to Add the EndPoint URL inside the Salesforce Application in
			"Remote Site Settings" option.
			
			Setup --> Administer --> Security Controls.
				1. Click on "Remote Site Settings" link.
				2. Click on "New Remote Site" button.
				3. Specify the Remote Site Name and Description
				4. Specify the URL / Path of Remote Site.
				5. Click on "Save" button.
				
	Step 3: Connect to the Third Party System / WebService by using HTTP,
			HTTPRequest and HttpResponse Classes 
			
	Step 4: Get the Response Returned by WebService and Parse the Content and
			represent inside the application.

 JSON:
=====
	JSON --> Java Script Object Notation.

	It is a most commonly used message format for applications irrespective of languages.
	
	Any programming language can understand JSON. Hence JSON is the most commonly used to message format for Interoperability.
	
	Ex:
		Salesforce		---> Request (JSON) ---> Java 
		Application		<--- Response (JSON) --- Application

	JSON is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for data interchange.

	The JSON format was originally specified by "Douglas Crockford".

	It was designed for human-readable data interchange.

	It has been extended from the JavaScript scripting language.

	The filename extension is ".json".

	JSON Internet Media type is "application/json".

Uses of JSON:
=============
	1. JSON format is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over network connection.
	
	2. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and web applications.
	
	3. Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data.
	
	4. It can be used with modern programming languages.
	
Characteristics of JSON:
========================
	1. JSON is easy to read and write
	2. It is a lightweight text-based interchange format.
	3. JSON is language independent.

Rules:
======
	JSON syntax is basically considered as a subset of JavaScript syntax; it includes the following.
	
		1. Data is represented in "Key-Value" pairs.
		2. Curly braces hold objects and each name is followed by ':'(colon), the "Key-Value" pairs are separated by , (comma).
		3. Square brackets hold arrays and values are separated by ,(comma).
		
	Syntax:
		{"Key":"Value"}
		
	Ex:
		{"Name":"Ramesh"}

Supported Data Structures:
==========================
	JSON supports the following two data structures
	
		1. Collection of "Key-Value" pairs:
			This Data Structure is supported by different programming languages.
			
		2. Ordered list of values:
			Which includes array, list, etc.

JSON Data Types:
================
	JSON format supports the following data types
	
Number DataType:
================
	This DataType is used to store the Numerical Values including "Integer Part and Decimal Part also".
	
	Note: Numerical values no need to be enclosed in the double quotes.
	
Syntax:
	{"Key":<Value>}
	
Ex:
	{"CustomerCode":1001}
	{"AnnualRevenue":2500000}
	{"ServiceTax":2500.50}
	{"ProductWeight":45.750}
	
String DataType:
================
	String DataType allows us to store a Collection of characters including the special characters.
	
Syntax:
	{"Key":"Value"}
	
Ex:
	{"CustomerName":"Ramesh Kumar"}
	{"Location":"Mumbai"}
	{"Rating":"Hot"}
	{"Industry":"Banking"}
	{"EmailID":"sureshkumar@gmail.com"}
	
Boolean DataType:
=================
	This DataType allows us to store the TRUE / FALSE values.
	
Syntax:
	{"Key":<Value>}
	
Ex:
	{"ActiveStatus":true}
	{"IsInStock":true}
	{"IsBlocked":false}
	{"CanDelete":false}
	
Array DataType:
===============
	Arrays allows us to store a collection of Homogeneous Elements. i.e. Arrays allows us to store the Similar DataType elements inside the format.
	
	Array elements should be enclosed inside the "Square Braces". Each element inside the array will be segregated by using a comma.
	
	Each element inside the array will get recognized by using an index position starting from "Zero".
	
Syntax:
	{
		"Key":[<Value1>,<Value2>,<Value3>,....., <ValueN>]
	}
	
UseCase:
--------
	Define an array to store a collection Customer Codes, which are Numerical Values.
	
	{
		"CustomerCodes":[1001,1002,1004,1007,1009,1211]
	}
	
UseCase:
--------
	Define an Array to store the Collection of Country Names.
	
	{
		"CountryNames":[
							'USA',
							'India',
							'Australia',
							'Japan',
							'Middle East',
							'China',
							'Germany'
						]
	}
	
Object DataType:
================
	Object DataType is used to store a collection of elements of Heterogeneous type.
	
	Object should be always enclosed in the "Square Braces". We can place "N" number of elements inside the object by separating a comma.
	
	1. Each Object will be get represented in the form of "Key-Value" pair.
	
	2. Key should be a String Type.
	
	3. Value can be an "Object / An Array of Objects".
	
Syntax:
	{
		"KeyName": {
						"Key":"Value",
						"Key":"Value",
						"Key":"Value",
						...
						"Key":"Value"
				   }
	}
	
Ex:
	{
		"CustomerRecord":{
							"CustomerCode":1001,
							"CustomerName":"Srinivas",
							"Address":"Hyderabad",
							"Salary":2000000,
							"PhoneNumber":"9900998877",
							"IsActive":true
						 }
	}

JSONGenerator Class:
====================
This Class is used to implement the Serialization process through Programatically. We can convert the Apex Object Types into the String formats by using JSONGenerator Class.

We need to Create the JSONGenerator Object as below.

Syntax:
	System.JSONGenerator <objectName> = System.JSON.CreateGenerator(true);
	
Ex:
	System.JSONGenerator jsonGen = System.JSON.CreateGenerator(true);
	
To represent the Apex Types into the JSON format, we have to use the below methods.

Methods:
--------
	1. WriteStartObject()
		This method is used to write the Starting Of the object (i.e. Starting Curly braces) in the JSON content.
		
	2. WriteEndObject()
		This method is used to write the Ending Of the object (i.e. Ending Curly braces) in the JSON content.
		
	3. WriteStartArray()
		This method is used to write the Starting Of the Array (i.e. Starting Square braces) in the JSON content.
	
	4. WriteEndArray()
		This method is used to write the Ending Of the Array (i.e. Ending Square braces) in the JSON content.
	
	5. WriteFieldName('FieldName'):
		This method is used to Create a New Element in the JSON Content. It will write the "FieldName".
		
		Ex:
			WriteFieldName('CustomerCode');
			
	6. WriteNumber(Number):
		This method is used to include the "Numerical value" as the Value for the specified element.
		
		Ex:
			WriteNumber(1001);
			
	7. WriteString(StringValue):
		This method is used to include the "String value" as the Value for the specified element.
		
		Ex:
			WriteString('Pawan Kumar');
			
	8. WriteBoolean(TRUE / False):
		This method is used to include the "Boolean value" as the Value for the specified element.

		Ex:
			WriteBoolean(true);
			
	9. WritNull():
		This method is used to include the "Null value" as the Value for the specified element.

		Ex: 
			WriteNull();
			
	10. WriteDate(DateValue);
		This method is used to include the "Date value" as the Value for the specified element.
			
		Ex:
			WriteDate(Date.NewInstance(1990,02,24));

JSONParser Class:
=================
JSONParser Class is used to achieve the DeSerialization Process. i.e. We can Convert the JSON String into our own Object Types.

Upon invoking / consuming the third party WebServices, it will returns the result in the form of JSON format. 

We need to convert the JSON format of content into our own type by using "JSONParser" Class, So that we can use the response inside the application to be get represented inside the VF Page / Store inside the Database / we can use this response as the input for the another WebService call.

i.e. We need to split the complete JSON String into the various smaller pieces called as "Tokens" and we need to iterate the content from starting to ending and we need to parse the content into our own object types.

JSONParser Class provides a set of readymade methods to be used to parse the JSON string into our own object types.

Create the Object of the JSONParser Class as below..
Syntax:
	System.JSONParser <objectName> = System.JSON.CreateParser(<JSONString>);
	
Methods:
	1. NextToken():
		This method is used to move the cursor to the next token inside the JSON string.
		
	2. GetCurrentToken():
		This method is used to get the current Token value.
		
	3. GetText():
		This method is used to collect the current token value in the form of a String.
		
	4. GetBooleanValue():
		To get the Boolean Value exist in the current token.
		
	5. GetDecimalValue():
		If the current token value is a Decimal, then we can collect the decimal value by using this method.
		
	6. GetDateTimeValue():
		If the current token value is of type "DateTime", then we can collect the value by using this method.
		
JSONToken Enumeration:
======================
Upon parsing the JSON String by dividing into the various small tokens, to identify each token token type we have to use "JSONToken" enumeration. 	 

i.e. We can identify the current token DataType, So that we can fetch the token value and store inside the associated field / variable.

JSONToken provides the below Constants.
	1. FIELD_NAME
	2. START_OBJECT
	3. END_OBJECT
	4. START_ARRAY
	5. END_ARRAY
	6. VALUE_NULL
	7. VALUE_STRING
	8. VALUE_TRUE
	9. VALUE_FALSE
	10. VALUE_NUMBER_INT
	11. VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT

OAuth Authentication:
=====================
OAuth --> Open Authentication

Connected App:
	|
	 --> Consumer Secret / Client  Secret
		 Consumer Key / Client ID


UserName Password Flow:
=======================
	Step 1: We need Two Salesforce.com Organizations.
	
		Provider Organization: training.batch330@cis.com (Chrome)	
		Consumer Organization: training.batch331@cis.com (FireFox)
	
	Step 2: Create the WebService inside the Provider Organization.
	
	WebService:
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/CaseRecordService/*')
		Global class CaseRecordDetailsService 
		{
			@HttpGet
			Global static Case GetCaseDetailsByID()
			{
				Map<String,String> mapInputs =	RestContext.request.Params;
				
				Case csRecord = [Select id, caseNumber, status, priority, origin, reason, subject, description
											from Case
												Where id =: mapInputs.Get('Id')];
				
				return csRecord;
			}
		}
		
		EndPoint: https://ap16.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/CaseRecordService
		Method Type: GET
	
	Step 3: Create a Connected App inside the Provider Organization, and Generate
			the Client ID, and Client Secret.
			
			Setup --> Build --> Create --> Apps --> Connected Apps
				1. Click on "New" Button.
				2. Enter the Connected App Name and Description.
				3. Enter the CallBack URL / Redirect URL.
					(Ex: https://ap15.salesforce.com/apex/OAuthUserNamePassword)
				4. Enter the Email ID.
				5. Grant the Permissions.
					1. Select the "Full Permissions".
				6. Click on "Save" button.
				
			Observation:
				It will Create a Connected App, and Will generate the Client ID and Client Secret.
				
			Client ID: 3MVG9G9pzCUSkzZslWuDM1ffFPq1jIRCMnxyWW2GW_qtWROzFGRHfRKCj.nYg117pSyFQOWkaPfqnSjXE5rfF
			
			Client Secret: 2BEF1D09B41211D52F7D4896570F4D9473E87B18111F345CAEC3EE809C1927A7
			
	Step 4: Create a User Account inside the Provider Organization.
			User Name: training.batch330@cis.com
			Password : India@2020

	Step 5: Supply the Required Details to the Consumer Organization.
				1. Client ID / Consumer Key
				2. Client Secret / Consumer Secret
				3. User Name
				4. Password
				
	Step 6: Write the Business Logic inside the Consumer Organization to Get the
				Access Token by Authorizing with "Authorization Server".
				
				6.1. Get the Salesforce Authorization Server URL from Salesforce
					Documentation to get Authorized.
					Ex:
						https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
						
				6.2. Add the Authorization URL inside the Remote Site Settings of
					Consumer Organization.
						
				6.3. Make a HTTP Request to the Authorization Server, by passing the required parameters and Get the Response, which includes the "Access Token".
					Parameters:
						Grant_type=password
						Client_id=<ClientID>
						Client_secret=<ClientSecret>
						username=<username>
						password=<password>
					Method Type: POST
				Observation:
					Authorization Server will validate all the parameters and will get generate an "Access Token" and send to the Consumer Organization.
					
	Step 7: Once the Consumer Organization receives the Access Token from the
			Authorization Server, then we need to parse the JSON content and get the
			Access Token.		
			
	Step 8: Make a HTTP Request to the Resource Server / WebService to invoke the
			WebService and Get the Response.
			
			8.1. Get the Resource Server URL / EndPoint.
			8.2. Prepare a HTTP Request to invoke the WebService.
			8.3. Pass the "Access Token" along with the HTTP Request.
			8.4. Get the Response from the Resource Server / WebService
			8.5. Parse the JSON Response received from Resource Server and
				represent the result on the Visualforce Page / Store inside the Database object.
			
UseCase:
========
	Design a Visualforce Page, to Get the Case Record Details from the Provider Organization based on the Case Id supplied at runtime. And represent the Case Details on the Visualforce Page.
	
	Provider Organization: training.batch330@cis.com (Chrome)	
	Consumer Organization: training.batch331@cis.com (FireFox)

        Case csRecord = [Select id, caseNumber, status, priority, origin, reason, subject, description
                              from Case
                                Where id =: mapInputs.Get('Id')];

Future CallOuts with OAuth 2.0:
===============================

	Step 1: We need Two Salesforce.com Organizations.
			
			Provider Organization: training.batch330@cis.com (Chrome)	
			Consumer Organization: training.batch331@cis.com (FireFox)

	Step 2: (Provider) Create a WebService to expose to the Third Party Systems.
			It should receive the input parameters from the Third Party System and will create a New Record inside the Hiring Manager Object.
			
		Service Class:
		--------------
			@RestResource(URLMapping='/HiringManagerService/*')
			Global class HiringManagerRecordsService 
			{
				@HttpPost()
				Global static string InsertNewHRRecord(string hrName, string hrCity, string hrPhone, string hrEmail)
				{
					Hiring_Manager__C hrRecord = new Hiring_Manager__C();
					
						hrRecord.Name = hrName;
						hrRecord.Location__c = hrCity;
						hrRecord.Email_ID__c = hrEmail;
						hrRecord.Contact_Number__c = hrPhone;
						
					insert hrRecord;
					
					return 'Success';
				}
			}
	
	Step 3: (Provider) Create a Connected App and Generate the Client ID / Client Secret.
	
		Setup --> Build --> Create --> Apps --> Connected Apps
				1. Click on "New" Button.
				2. Enter the Connected App Name and Description.
				3. Enter the CallBack URL / Redirect URL.
					(Ex: https://ap15.salesforce.com/apex/OAuthUserNamePassword)
				4. Enter the Email ID.
				5. Grant the Permissions.
					1. Select the "Full Permissions".
				6. Click on "Save" button.

			Client ID: 3MVG9G9pzCUSkzZslWuDM1ffFPq1jIRCMnxyWW2GW_qtWROzFGRHfRKCj.nYg117pSyFQOWkaPfqnSjXE5rfF
			
			Client Secret: 2BEF1D09B41211D52F7D4896570F4D9473E87B18111F345CAEC3EE809C1927A7
	
	Step 4: (Provider) Create a User Record inside the Organization, to be get shared to
				Consumer.
			
			User Name: training.batch330@cis.com
			Password : India@2021
			
	Step 5: (Provider) Supply the required Input values to the Consumer / Client.
	
				1. Client ID / Consumer Key
				2. Client Secret / Consumer Secret
				3. User Name and Password
				4. WebService EndPoint URL.
				
	Step 6: (Consumer) Consumer should get the Access Token, by connecting to the
			Authorization Server by passing the required input parameters.
			
	Step 7: (Consumer) Once the Access Token has been received by the Consumer, it
			should invoke the WebService based on the EndPoint URL by passing the input parameters for the WebService

WebServices: (web services)
============
WebService are nothing but the Custom Business Logic, which can be accessible by the External Systems.

By using WebServices we can provide the communication between the different disparate systems, which has been developed by using different programming languages and running on different platforms.

WebServices provides the Platform-independent communication between the applications.

		Salesforce		<------ WebServices  ------>    Java
		Application						  				Application	
		
By using WebServices, we can expose the Data(Records), Business Logics and functionalities to the Third Party Systems.

By using Apex Programming, we can implement 2 Types of WebServices

	1. REST Based WebServices
	2. SOAP Based WebServices
	
REST Based WebServices / Apex REST:
===================================
	REST --> Representational State Transfer.
	
	By using REST,  we can access the Resources over the internet with the help of HTTP protocol.
	
	REST is an Architectural Style, which has been purely built upon HTTP protocol. It used the HTTP protocol internally to provide the communication between the applications.
	
	In REST WebServices, each Object, Business Logic and Class and Functionalities should be implemented in the form of a "Resource".
	
	Each Resource should be identified by using a "Resource Name". The Developer can provide the resource name based on the need.
	
	Ex:
		Table Name		Resource Name
		-------------------------------
		Account 			001
		Contact				003
		Opportunity			006
		Case				500
		Solution			501
		Lead				00Q
		Campaign			701
		Order				801
		User				005
		Task				00T
		Event				00U
		Group				00G
		...
		...
	
	Every resource can be accessible by using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
	Ex:
		https://sample.com/<resourceName>
		
	Ex:
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/001 ---> Account Object Records
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/500 ---> Case Object Records
		
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/apex/ShowAllAccountsPage ---> Visualforce Page
		
	To access the resources we have to specify the HTTP Method, which indicates what type of operation the user wants to perform on the resource. 
	
	HTTP Protocol provides the below Methods.
	
		1. GET (To Retrieve the Records from the Resource / Object)
		2. POST (To Insert the Records into the Resource / Object)
		3. PUT  (To Update the records into the Resource)
		4. PATCH (To Perform both INSERT + UPDATE operations on the resource)
		5. DELETE (To Delete the records from the object / resource)
		
	Note:
		REST based WebServices can provide the results in the form of "XML / JSON / TEXT".
		
	Upon Creating the REST WebServices, we have to use the below Annotations.

		1. @RestResource()
		2. @HttpGet()
		3. @HttpPost()
		4. @HttpPut()
		5. @HttpPatch()
		6. @HttpDelete()
		
@RestResource:
==============
	This annotation is used to expose an apex class / business logic class to the Third Party Applications.
	
	Inside the Class, we can provide the required Business Logic in the form of various methods.
	
	Note:
		Always WebService class should be defined with "Global" access specifier. We have to specify the resource name for the class by using "@RestResource()" annotation on top of the Class as below.
		
	Syntax:
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/<ResourceName>/*')
		Global Class <ClassName>
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
		
	Ex:
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountsService/*')
		Global Class AccountsManager
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
		
		
		@RestResource(URLMapping='/CommonService/*')
		Global Class CommonHelper
		{
			// Write the Business Logic...
		}
		
Accessing the Resource:
-----------------------
	We can access / invoke each Resource by using a URI over the "http protocol".
	
	Syntax:
		https://<ServerNumber>.Salesforce.com/services/apexrest/<ResourceName>
		
	Ex:
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/CommonService
		
		https://ap16.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/AccountsService
		
	We can invoke / test the rest WebServices by using the below tools.

			1. Workbench Tool
			2. Postman Tool
			3. HP QTP Tool
			4. Through Apex Programming
			5. By using Third Party Applications
			6. By using Integration Tools
				(Ex: Tibco, WeMethods, SeeBeyond, BizTalk, MuleSoft,...etc.)
		
@HttpGet Method:
================
This annotation is used to get the required resource information from the Provider to Consumer.

Note: This annotation can be applicable only on method level (i.e. Procedure / Function)

Note:
	All the WebService methods should be defined with "Global" access specifier, and should be defined as "Static".
	
Syntax:
	@HttpGet
	Global static <ReturnType> <MethodName>()
	{
		// Write the Business Logic..
	}
	
Note:
	We can't create multiple methods inside the WebService class with the same annotation.
	(Ex: We can have only one "@HttpGet" annotated method inside the WebService class).
	
Ex:
	@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountRecordsService/*')
	Global Class AccountsManager
	{
		@HttpGet
		Global Static List<Account> GetAllAccounts()
		{
			// Write the Business Logic..
		}
	}
	
UseCase:
========
	Create a Restful WebService to get All the Account Records from the Account Object.
	
WebService Class:
-----------------
@RestResource(URLMapping='/AccountsService/*')
Global class AccountsManagerService 
{
    @HttpGet
	Global static List<Account> GetAllAccountRecords()
    {
        List<Account> lstAccounts = [Select id, name, rating, industry, annualrevenue,
                                    				phone, fax, type, active__C
                                    					from Account
                                    						Order by name];
        
        return lstAccounts;

	3. Create a WebService, to access all the Position Records whose Status is "In Progress".
	
RestContext Class:
==================
This Class is used to establish the secured communication channel between the Provider and the Consumer. So that Consumer can pass the required input parameters to the Provider.

Then provider can return the required information to the consumer.

It contains the below inner Classes.

	1. RestRequest Class;
		This Class is used to make a request to the WebService to get the required information.
		
		The Consumer can pass the required input parameters to the WebService by using RestRequest class, so that they can get the required response from the WebService.
		
		Note:
			It will store the input parameters in the form of "Key-Value" pairs. Where Key --> Parameter Name. Value --> Parameter Value.
			
		Ex:
						Key				 Value
					  ---------------------------------
					    Id				'001464564564'
						Name			'Test'
						Rating			'Education'
						AnnualRevenue 	10000
			
		Property:
			Params:
				This property contains all the Input Parameters supplied by the Consumer to the WebService Class.
				
				It contains the information in the form of a Map Collection. We can collect the input parameters from the "RestRequest" class as below.
				
				Syntax:
					Map<String,String> <objectName> = RestContext.Request.Params;
					
				Ex:
					Map<String, String> inputParams = RestContext.Request.Params;
					
	2. RestResponse Class:
		By using this class, we can collect the response from the WebService class to the Third Party Application.
